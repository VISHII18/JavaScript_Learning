* In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.
  A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.
  
Example 1:
let a, b, c;     ----->  Statement 1
a = 5;           ----->  Statement 2
b = 6;           ----->  Statement 3
c = a * b;       ----->  Statement 4

Here , each line is a statement that represent the line of code with some meaning in it, On statement one we declaired the variable a,b and c .
on statement 2 and 3 , we have assign numeric value to the variable a and b , and statement 4 is holding the value of variable c which the produch of a and b.
thus , each line of code is considered as statement.

Example 2:

var x,y; ------( Var is also can be use to initialize variable)
let x, y;
x = 5 + 6;
y = x * 10;

With the above understanding we have 4 statement in example 2.  calculating result of would be y= 110 .
